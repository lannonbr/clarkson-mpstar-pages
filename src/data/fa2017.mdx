## MirrorBandwidth and New Mirror source

I've been working on creating a new frontend for Mirror's Statistics. I haven't gotten a beta version that is live on Mirror yet, but I plan on doing such in early January. The source for the client is available [here](https://github.com/COSI-Lab/MirrorDash-Client).

Now Official Mirrors for VLC & Blender.

DistroUsage: ~8TB VLC, ~67TB Blender, 47TB LibreOffice, 47TB LinuxMint, 37TB ParrotSec

PB Countdown: Should be reaching it 1st week in January

## Other things

Lightning talks, [Super Mario Odyssey Alexa Skill](https://github.com/lannonbr/speedrunner), Git Workshop, Open House, other web dev stuff, you get the gist.

## Plans for 2018

More MirrorBandwidth work, More Workshops on Web dev stuff, hand off services.
