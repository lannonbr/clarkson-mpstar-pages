## Hack Potsdam

Hack Potsdam was likely one of my longest and most stressful events that I helped put on but I was amazed with how well it went and so grateful for it.

## Lab Director stuff

Self explanitory, COSI Meetings, Open House, etc. I'm out

## COSI Place Alexa Skill

Within two days COSI wanted to clone /r/place and Graham and I developed it. I was involved with making a skill for the Amazon Echo to interface with the site.

## IgniteCS / Project Challenge

I wasn't involved much this semester with IgniteCS, but I was happy that we were able to get people involved with CS.

## Git Workshop

Amanda wanted a git workshop around time of the career fair, so I put it on.

## Talks

Talks has been serving the labs weekly very well. over 618 talks have been pushed since it's launch in March 2016

## Lightning Talks

I had a lot. Well worth it

## Mirror Website

The site's been running well, and with the stats, we've been going for 1 year and it has almost been steadily increasing with bandwidth since.
