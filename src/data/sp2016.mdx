## New Mirror's website ([Link](http://mirror.clarkson.edu/))

A refresh to the website was well overdue, and with this update, all of the content is going to be regularly updated as things change on New Mirror. The site is now also becoming mobile friendly which is good since the majority of devices accessing the internet are no longer desktops. This also was done from scratch compared to the bias that it looks like something built in Twitter Bootstrap

## [Dubsdot](https://dubsdot.cslabs.clarkson.edu/)

This is COSI's newest webserver running as a VM on Bennu. It was a smooth transition to get the old VMs of Talks, Fsuvius, and Print onto Dubsdot and I have written some documentation on putting sites onto it here as well as a page on Dubsdot itself on Docs.

## Created [Talks 2.0](http://talks.cosi.clarkson.edu/) ([Github](https://github.com/COSI-Lab/NodeTalks/))

Talks 2.0 was a complete redesign of the talks webapp made last semester. It now includes sorting by category, and although there are a few kinks in it at the moment, I will likely fix them after finals.

## Helped with Malone Python Workshop

I was very pleased with the people who helped volunteer for the workshop the afternoon of Accepted Student's Day. We didn't get through the entire workshop, but it is was good to increase the external image of COSI to the community.

## Main contact for Lockheed Martin talk

There was some issues with the timing for Charlie Murphy to come give a talk, but we finally got him to come to the labs at the end of March.

## LaTeX workshop

Gave a workshop on using LaTeX

## Helped out at the Accepted Students day presentation

We had a large amount of students that we needed three rooms to do presentations, but I am very hopeful on the next generation of COSI in this upcoming August.

## Lighting Talks

- Vivaldi
- CodePen
- Gulp
