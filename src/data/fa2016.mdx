## Progress so far

- COSI Orientation (Welcome Carnival, Activities Fair)
- Mirror website maintenance (We should hit 200TB of total traffic by the end of 2016.)
- [NodeTalks](http://talks.cslabs.clarkson.edu/): I've been working on the maintenance of Talks by slowly improving it to work on mobile devices and other features such as the parsing to meeting minutes.
- Lightning Talks: I have been trying to give at least one or two lightning talks every week to be able to give my expertise to others. Some talks include topics such as Intro to COSI, NodeTalks, Wat, Tetros, Yarn, Hack Upstate, CSS animations, Advent of Code, and Github Pages
- Git Workshop
- LaTeX Workshop
- Contact for companies who talked at career fair (GE, Siege)
- Lab Director duties
- Working on Hack Potsdam
- COSI News: I've been pushing newsletters including info about things going on during the week and news about cosi. I've been doing this on and off, but plan on doing it weekly in 2017.
- COSI Webdev: I've begun work on COSI webdev with a few intro meetings and plans for projects to be working on, which will be done throughout next semester.

## Spring 2017 topics

- COSI Webdev: As one of the few noticable web developers in COSI, I am wanting to create a group of cosinaughts to help manage the sites as well as try to unify a single brand for COSI.
- CRI: I am interested in doing research involving maching learning / data science next semester (Will likely plan ideas over break)
