Hi. My name is Benjamin Lannon and I am a first year student at Clarkson, and a fellow member of COSI for the majority of the time I have been here. I currently am taking MP151 for 0 credits to just get into the swing of things here at Clarkson.

## What do I do?

Things I do in COSI consist of:

- Created a makefile maker and did a lightning talk on it.
- Attend the weekly meetings
- Helped out with both open houses for this fall.
- Part of the Core Maintainers

## Where do I want to go?

By The end of this year, I am hoping to be able to pick up some services in the labs. Being able to maintain something will keep the labs from not having to worry when someone is going to graduate and know that they have been able to help someone learn what they know.
